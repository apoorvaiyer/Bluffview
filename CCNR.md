(a) Conditions and Restrictions. All Lots within the Property will be owned, held, encumbered, leased, used, occupied and enjoyed subject to all of the terms, easements, restrictions, covenants and conditions contained in this Declaration and the other Governing Documents.

(b) Ordinances. Ordinances and requirements imposed by local governmental authorities are applicable to all Lots within the Property. Compliance with the Governing Documents is mandatory and is not a substitute for compliance with applicable law. Please be advised that the Governing Documents do not purport to list or describe each legal requirement or restriction which may be applicable to a Lot located within the Property. Each Owner is advised to review the Plat applicable to their Lot, all applicable laws, and all other requirements, regulations and encumbrances affecting the use and improvement of their Lot prior to submitting plans to the ACA for approval. Furthermore, approval by the ACA should not be construed by the Owner that any improvement complies with the terms and provisions of any applicable law, requirements, regulations or encumbrances which may affect the Owner's Lot. Certain encumbrances may benefit parties whose interests are not addressed by the ACA. The Association, each Owner, resident, or other user of any portion of the Property must comply with the Governing Documents and applicable law, as supplemented, modified or amended from time to time. The Plat includes certain building restrictions, and each Owner is advised to review the Plat applicable to their Lot prior to constructing any improvements on their Lot. Additionally, as specified in the Plat, the maintenance of certain easements and other improvements within the Property shall be the responsibility of the Association, and pursuant to Section 8.01, the Association shall accept such interests for operation and maintenance.

2.02 Owners' Use and Enjoyment of Common Areas. Every Owner will have a right and non-exclusive easement of use, access and enjoyment in and to the Common Areas, subject to all rights and limitations set forth herein, including, without limitation, the following:

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

(b) Suspension of Common Area Use Rights. The right of the Association to suspend the right of use of the Common Areas for any period of time during which any assessment against such Owner's Lot is due and remains unpaid.

(c) Conveyance of Common Area. The right of the Association, subject to the provisions hereof, to dedicate, sell or transfer all or any part of the Common Areas.

(d) Mortgage Common Area. The right of the Association, subject to the provisions hereof, to mortgage or lien all or any part of the Common Areas.

(e) Dedication of Common Area. The right of the Declarant, during the Development Period, and the Board thereafter, to dedicate or transfer all or any part of the Common Area to any public agency, authority or utility for any purpose.

(f) Easements. The right of the Declarant, during the Development Period, and the Board, with the advance written approval of the Declarant during the Development Period, to grant easements or licenses over and across the Common Area.

2.03 Restrictions Regarding Owners' Rights in Common Areas. Each Owner's right and easement of use and enjoyment in and to the Common Area is further limited as follows:

(a) No Transfer without Lot. An Owner's right and easement of use and enjoyment in and to the Common Area shall not be conveyed, transferred, alienated or encumbered separate and apart from an Owner's Lot.

(b) No Partition. Except as provided in Section 2.02(c) hereof, the Common Area shall remain undivided and no action for partition or division of any part thereof shall be permitted.

2.04 Right to Delegate Use and Enjoyment of Common Area. Any Owner may extend his or her right of use and enjoyment to the members of such Owner's family, lessees and guests, as applicable, subject to the terms of this Declaration, the Bylaws and any reasonable Rules and Regulations. An Owner who leases such Owner's Dwelling is deemed to have assigned all such rights to the lessee of such Dwelling.

2.05 Conceptual Plans. All master plans, site plans, brochures, illustrations, information and marketing materials relating to the Property or the Common Area (collectively, the "Conceptual Plans") are conceptual in nature and are intended to be used for illustrative purposes only. The land uses and improvements, including but not limited to any amenity centers and open spaces, reflected on the Conceptual Plans are subject to change at any time and from time to time, and it is expressly agreed and understood that land uses within the Property or the Common Area or outside of the Property may include uses which are not shown on the Conceptual Plans. Neither Declarant nor any Builder or other developer of any portion of the Property or the Common Area makes any representation or warranty concerning such land uses and improvements shown on the Conceptual Plans or otherwise planned for the Property or the Common Area and it is expressly agreed and understood that no Owner will be entitled to rely upon the Conceptual Plans or any statements made by the Declarant or any of Declarant's representatives regarding any existing or proposed land uses, or proposed or planned improvements in making the decision to purchase any land or improvements within the Property. Each Owner who acquires a Lot within the Property acknowledges that development of the Property and/or the Common Area will likely extend over many years, and agrees that the Association may not engage in, or use Association funds to support, any protest or challenge, or make any form of objection to, development of the Property or the Common Area or changes in the Conceptual Plans as they may be amended or modified from time to time.

ARTICLE III
MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING

3.01 Membership - Owners. Every Owner by virtue of ownership of a Lot or Land will be a member of the Association. Membership will be appurtenant to and will not be separated from ownership of any Lot or Land (as applicable).

3.02 Voting Rights. The voting rights in the Association shall be as follows:

(a) Members other than Declarant. Members shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each Lot owned. However, when more than one person or Member holds an interest in any Lot, only one vote in total may


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

be cast per Lot as the Owners of such Lot determine among themselves and advise the Secretary of the Association in writing prior to the vote being taken. The Association shall have no affirmative obligation to take any action to determine which Member is the person designated to cast the Lot's vote. If the Members fail to advise the Association of the person designated to cast the Lot's vote, then the Lot's vote shall be suspended if more than one person or entity seeks to exercise it.

(b) Declarant. In addition to the votes to which Declarant is entitled by reason of Section 3.02(a), for every one (1) vote outstanding in favor of any other person or entity, Declarant will have four (4) additional votes until the expiration or termination of the Development Period.

## ARTICLE IV
ASSESSMENTS

4.01 Obligation to Pay Assessments. Subject to and except as provided in this Article IV, each Owner of any Lot by acceptance of a deed therefor, whether or not it will be so expressed in such deed, is deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association: (a) annual assessments as provided in Section 4.03 hereof, (b) special assessments as provided in Section 4.06 hereof, and (c) specific assessments as provided in Section 4.07 hereof.

4.02 Rate of Assessments. Both annual assessments and special assessments shall be fixed at a uniform rate for all Lots, regardless of a Lot's location or size or the value of the Dwelling thereon; *provided*, however, that vacant Lots shall be subject to a lower rate as provided herein.

(a) Improved Lot. A Lot that has thereon a Dwelling that has been occupied at any time (past or current) for residential purposes (an "Improved Lot") shall be assessed at the full rate.

(b) Vacant Lot. A Lot that does not have thereon a Dwelling that has been occupied at any time (past or current) for residential purposes shall be assessed at the rate of 50% of the full rate.

(c) Lots and Land Owned by Declarant - Exempt. Except as provided in Section 4.05 below, during the Development Period all Lots owned by Declarant shall be exempt from all assessments (annual assessments, special assessments and/or specific assessments) and Declarant shall not be obligated to pay any assessments for the Lots. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Declarant shall never be obligated to pay assessments for any Land owned by Declarant.

4.03 Date of Commencement of Annual Assessments; Due Dates. The annual assessments provided for herein shall commence as to all Lots on the date of conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner (other than to Declarant, a Builder or an entity that assumes Declarant status as provided herein), unless the Board elects to commence the annual assessment earlier. Until January 1st of the year immediately following the conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner (other than to Declarant, a Builder or an entity that assumes Declarant status as provided herein), the annual assessment shall be $720 per Lot, provided that such first annual assessment shall be adjusted according to the number of months remaining in the calendar year. The amount of subsequent annual assessments against each Lot shall be fixed by the Board at least thirty (30) days in advance of each assessment period. Written notice of the annual assessment shall be sent to an Owner of every Lot subject thereto. The due dates shall be established by the Board. The Board shall also establish whether the annual assessment shall be paid annually, quarterly or monthly.

4.04 Annual Assessment - Increases. The annual assessment may be increased by the Board, provided that the Board gives written notice of the increase to the Members at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such increase.

4.05 Declarant's Obligation to Pay Budget Deficits. If at any time during the Development Period the Association's operating expenses exceed the assessments received by the Association from the Owners (a "Budget Deficit"), Declarant shall fund the amount of such deficit to the Association; provided, however, that in no event shall Declarant be obligated to pay more than an amount equal to the full assessment rate applicable to Improved Lots for the Lots (but not Land) Declarant owns to make up such Budget Deficit. If at any time there is more than one Declarant, the amount of such deficit to be paid by each Declarant shall be equal to the amount of such deficit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Lots then owned by that Declarant and the denominator is the total number of Lots then owned by all Declarants; provided, however, if all Declarants agree, then the amount of the deficit to be paid by each Declarant shall be equal to the full assessment rate applicable to Improved Lots for all Lots (but not Land) then owned by such Declarant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Budget Deficit is the result of the failure or refusal of an Owner or Owners to pay their annual, special or specific assessments, the Association will diligently pursue (and Declarant may also pursue at its option) all available remedies against such defaulting Owners and will promptly reimburse Declarant for any Budget Deficit funded by

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW

5


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

Declarant from any amounts collected from such Owner or Owners. In no event shall Declarant be obligated to pay any Budget Deficit attributable to the period of time after the Development Period. Furthermore, nothing in this Section shall in any way eliminate or diminish Declarant's exemption from all assessments when no Budget Deficit exists.

4.06 Special Assessments. In addition to the annual assessments authorized above, the Association may levy, in any assessment year, a special assessment whenever in the Board's opinion such special assessments are necessary to enable the Board to carry out the functions of the Association under the Governing Documents. The amount of any special assessments will be at the sole discretion of the Board.

4.07 Specific Assessments. The Association shall have the power to levy specific assessments against a particular Lot to (a) cover costs incurred in bringing a Lot into compliance with this Declaration, (b) cover costs incurred as a consequence of the conduct (or the failure to act) of the Owner or occupant of a Lot, their agents, contractors, employees, licensees, invitees or guests, and/or (c) collect any sums due by the Owner to the Association (other than annual assessments or special assessments or interest or late charges related thereto), including, without limitation, fines.

4.08 Purpose of Annual and Special Assessments - Reserve. Annual assessments and special assessments levied by the Association shall be used for Common Expenses. The Association may establish and maintain a reserve fund for the periodic maintenance, inspection, repair and replacement of improvements to the Common Maintenance Areas.

4.09 Personal Obligation to Pay Assessments. Each assessment provided for herein, together with interest at the Designated Interest Rate, late charges and collection costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be the personal obligation of the person who was the Owner of such Lot at the time when the assessment arose. Upon a transfer of title to a Lot, the grantee shall be jointly and severally liable for any assessments and other charges due at the time of conveyance. However, no mortgagee under a Recorded first purchase money mortgage or beneficiary of a Recorded first deed of trust (meaning any Recorded mortgage or deed of trust with first priority over other mortgages or deeds of trust), shall be liable for unpaid assessments which accrued prior to the mortgagee's acquisition of title. In addition, no mortgagee shall be required to collect assessments.

4.10 Capitalization of Association - Payment.

(a) Each Owner (other than Declarant) who purchases a Lot will pay a one-time initial contribution to the Association (the "Initial Contribution"), which amount shall be due immediately upon the transfer of title to the Lot. Upon the purchase of a Lot from Declarant, the Initial Contribution initially shall be $400.00, such amount being comprised of: (i) a contribution to the Association's reserve fund; and (ii) a working capital contribution to the Association. Upon each subsequent sale of a Lot with a completed Dwelling, the Initial Contribution shall be a working capital contribution to the Association in an amount determined from time to time by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion; however, the total amount of such Initial Contribution shall not exceed one-third of one percent (1/3%) of the "Selling Price" of the Lot. The "Selling Price" of a Lot shall be the total price paid to purchase the Lot, including the Dwelling and other improvements on the Lot (excluding any governmental transfer fees or taxes imposed on the transfer). The Initial Contribution need not be uniform among all Lots, and the Board is expressly authorized to levy initial capital contributions of varying amounts depending on the size, use and general character of the Lots then being made subject to such levy.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the following transfers will not be subject to the requirement to pay the Initial Contribution: (i) foreclosure of a deed of trust lien, tax lien, or the Association's assessment lien; (ii) transfer to, from, or by the Association; or (iii) voluntary transfer by an Owner to one or more co-owners, or to the Owner's spouse, child or parent. In the event of any dispute regarding the application of the Initial Contribution to a particular Owner, the Board's determination regarding application of the exemption will be binding and conclusive without regard to any contrary interpretation of this Section. The Initial Contribution will be in addition to, not in lieu of, any other assessments or other charges levied in accordance with this Article IV and will not be considered an advance payment of such assessments. During the Development Period, the Declarant, and, thereafter, the Board, will have the power to waive the payment of any Initial Contribution attributable to a Lot.

4.11 Failure to Pay Assessments; Remedies of the Association. With respect to any assessment or other sum due herein not paid within ten (10) days after the due date, the Association shall have the right to: (a) charge a late fee, in an amount determined by the Board; (b) charge interest on the amount due at the Designated Interest Rate from the due date until the date the sum is paid; (c) charge costs and fees related to the collection of the sum due; and/or (d) exercise any other remedies available to the Association as provided elsewhere in this Declaration. In addition, the Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same. No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by nonuse of

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW

6


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

the Common Maintenance Areas or abandonment of his or her Lot. The failure to pay assessments shall not by the terms of this Declaration constitute a default under an insured mortgage, unless otherwise provided by the terms of such mortgage.

4.12 Lien.

(a) Creation of Lien. Each assessment, together with such interest at the Designated Interest Rate, late charges and costs of collection, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, and any other fees or charges that are authorized under or pursuant to this Declaration, will be the personal obligation of the Owner of the Lot against which the Assessment is levied and will be secured by a lien hereby granted and conveyed by Declarant to the Association against each such Lot and all improvements thereon (such lien, with respect to any Lot not in existence on the date hereof, will be deemed granted and conveyed at the time that such Lot is created). Although no further action is required to create or perfect the lien, the Association may, as further evidence and notice of the lien, execute and Record a document setting forth as to any Lot, the amount of delinquent sums due the Association at the time such document is executed and the fact that a lien exists to secure the payment thereof. However, the failure of the Association to execute and Record any such document shall not, to any extent, affect the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the lien.

(b) Enforcement of Lien Judicial or Nonjudicial. The lien may be enforced by judicial foreclosure or by nonjudicial foreclosure; provided, however, that prior to any nonjudicial foreclosure, the Association shall first obtain a court order as required under Section 209.0092(a) of the Texas Property Code, as amended, and otherwise comply with any applicable prerequisites or requirements for nonjudicial foreclosure under applicable law, including, without limitation, Chapter 209 of the Texas Property Code, as amended. Each Owner by accepting title to a Lot hereby grants to the Association, whether or not it is so expressed in the deed or other instrument conveying such Lot to the Owner, a private power of nonjudicial sale. The Board may appoint, from time to time, any person including an officer, agent, trustee, substitute trustee or attorney, to exercise the Association's lien rights on behalf of the Association, including the power of sale. The appointment must be in writing and may be in the form of a resolution recorded in the minutes of a Board's meeting. A foreclosure must comply with the requirements of applicable law, including, without limitation, Chapter 209 of the Texas Property Code, as amended. A nonjudicial foreclosure must be conducted in accordance with the provisions applicable to the exercise of powers of sale as set forth in Section 51.002 of the Texas Property Code, as amended, or in any manner permitted by law. In any foreclosure, the Owner is required to pay the Association's costs and expenses for the proceedings, including reasonable attorneys' fees, subject to applicable provisions of the Bylaws and applicable law, such as Chapter 209 of the Texas Property Code, as amended. The Association has the power to bid on the lot at foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage and convey same.

(c) Subordination of Lien. The lien of the assessments provided for herein is subordinate to the lien of any Recorded first purchase money mortgage or deed of trust against a Lot.

(d) Effect of Conveyance. An Owner that conveys title to a Lot shall not be liable for assessments that are attributable to the period after the conveyance of the Lot, except as provided in Section 4.12(e) below. However, a conveyance of title to a Lot shall not affect the assessment lien or relieve the Owner that conveys the Lot from personal liability for any assessments attributable to the period prior to the date of the conveyance, except as provided in Section 4.12(e) below.

(e) Effect of Foreclosure. The foreclosure of a first purchase money mortgage, trustee's sale of a first deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof will extinguish the lien of such assessment as to payments attributable to the period prior to the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. However, a foreclosure of a first purchase money mortgage, trustee's sale of a first deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof will not relieve such Lot or Owner thereof from liability for any assessment attributable to the period after the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. The foreclosure of a first purchase money mortgage, trustee's sale of a first deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof shall not release the Owner whose Lot is being foreclosed, sold at a trustee's sale or conveyed pursuant to a deed in lieu from the Owner's obligation to pay assessments attributable to the period prior to the date of such foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. For purposes of this Declaration, the use of the term "first" in connection with a mortgage or deed of trust shall refer to the lien priority as compared to other mortgages or deeds of trust.

ARTICLE V

S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), to the extent applicable. In determining whether to obtain additional insurance and/or endorsements thereto that are discretionary the Board shall use its own business judgment to determine if such insurance and/or endorsement is advisable based on the cost and availability of the insurance and/or the endorsement compared to the risks associated therewith.

(c) Review of Policies. The Board shall periodically review the types and amounts of insurance coverage for sufficiency.

5.06 Contracts; Management and Maintenance. The Association shall have the right to contract with any person or entity for the performance of various duties and functions. This right shall include, without limitation, the right to enter into management, operational or other agreements with other persons or entities; provided, however, that any such agreement shall require approval of the Board. The Board may employ for the Association a management agent or agents at such compensation as the Board may establish, to perform such duties and services as the Board shall authorize. The Board may delegate such powers as are necessary to perform the manager's assigned duties, but shall not delegate policymaking authority.

Such sanctions may include all remedies available at law and/or in equity and all remedies herein, including, without limitation, the following:

(a) Fines. The Association may impose reasonable monetary fines which shall constitute a lien upon the Owner of the Lot related to or connected with the alleged violation. The Owner shall be liable for the actions of any occupant, guest or invitee of the Owner of such Lot.

(b) Suspension of Rights to Use Common Area. The Association may suspend any person's or entity's right to use any Common Area; provided, however, that nothing herein shall authorize the Association to limit ingress or egress to or from a Lot.

(c) Right of Self-Help. The Association may exercise self-help or take action to enter upon the Lot to abate any violation of this Declaration.

(d) Right to Require Removal. The Association may require an Owner, at the Owner's expense, to remove any structure or improvement on such Owner's Lot in violation of this Declaration and to restore the Lot to its previous condition and, upon failure of the Owner to do so, the Association or its designee shall have the right to enter the Lot, remove the violation and restore the property to substantially the same condition as previously existed, without such action being deemed a trespass.

(e) Levy Specific Assessment. The Association may levy a specific assessment to cover costs incurred by the Association in bringing a Lot into compliance with this Declaration.

(f) Lawsuit; Injunction or Damages. The Association has the right, but not the obligation, to bring a suit at law or in equity to enjoin any violation or to recover monetary damages, or both.

The decision to pursue enforcement action, including the commencement of legal proceedings, in any particular case shall be left to the Association's sole and absolute discretion, except that the Association shall not be arbitrary or capricious in taking enforcement action. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the Association may determine that, under the circumstances of a particular case: (i) the Association's position is not strong enough to justify taking any or further action; (ii) the covenant, restriction or rule being enforced is, or is likely to be construed as, inconsistent with applicable law; (iii) although a technical violation may exist or may have occurred, it is not of such a material nature as to be objectionable to a reasonable person or to justify expending the Association's resources; or (iv) it is not in the Association's best interests, based upon hardship, expense or other reasonable criteria, to pursue enforcement action. Such a decision shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of the Association to enforce such provision at a later time under other circumstances or preclude the Association from enforcing any other covenant, restriction or rule.

5.10 Right of Action. The Association shall not have the power to institute, pursue, join, intervene in, settle or compromise litigation, arbitration or other proceedings: (i) in the name of or on behalf of any Owner (whether one or more); or (ii) pertaining to a claim relating to the design, construction or repair of a Dwelling, a Lot or any improvements on a Lot (other than a Claim (as defined below) relating to Common Maintenance Areas on one or more Lots). This Section may not be amended or modified without Declarant's written and acknowledged consent and the consent of Members entitled to cast at least one hundred percent (100%) of the total number of votes of the Association, both of which must be part of the Recorded amendment instrument.

## ARTICLE VI
ARCHITECTURAL CONTROLS

6.01 No Improvements Unless Approved by Architectural Control Authority. No building, fence, wall, outbuilding, landscaping, pool, detached building, athletic or play equipment or facility, structure or improvement will be erected, altered, added onto or repaired upon any portion of any Lot without the prior written consent of the ACA. However, ACA approval is not required for (a) any improvements constructed, erected, altered, added onto or repaired by Declarant or any Co-Declarant, or a Builder designated in writing by Declarant during the Development Period to be exempt from the ACA approval requirements; (b) any improvements to the interior of a Dwelling, except as provided herein; (c) the painting or re-bricking of the exterior of any Dwelling in accordance with the same color or design as originally constructed by Declarant or in accordance with the approved color and design scheme approved by the ACA; (d) improvements for which this Declaration expressly states that the ACA's prior approval is not required; or (e) repair or replacement of worn out or damaged improvements if such repair or replacement is with substantially similar materials. Any improvements pursuant to clauses (c) and (e) immediately preceding must be in compliance with any applicable ACA Standards.

6.02 Architectural Control Authority. The ACA shall have the sole and exclusive authority to perform the functions contemplated by the ACA in this Declaration. The purpose of the ACA is to enforce the architectural standards of the Property and to approve or disapprove plans for improvements proposed for the Lots. The ACA will have the authority to delegate its duties or to retain the services of a professional engineer, management company, architect, designer, inspector or other person to assist in the performance of its duties. The cost of such services shall be included in the Common Expenses. The "ACA" or "Architectural Control Authority" shall be the following entity:

(a) Declarant - During Development Period. Declarant shall be the ACA during the Development Period, unless Declarant has earlier terminated its rights as the ACA in writing. Declarant may, but shall not be obligated to, form an "Architectural Committee" during the Development Period. If Declarant forms an Architectural Committee during the Development Period, then during the Development Period the Architectural Committee will be acting solely in Declarant's interest and will owe no duty to any other Owner or the Association.

(b) Architectural Committee - After the Development Period. The Architectural Committee shall be the ACA after Declarant's right to act as the ACA has either expired or voluntarily been terminated.

6.03 Architectural Committee. Once formed, the Architectural Committee will be composed of not more than four (4) persons (who need not be Members or Owners) appointed as provided below, who will review improvements proposed to be made by any Owner other than Declarant. During the Development Period, Declarant will have the right to appoint and remove (with or without cause) all members of the Architectural Committee. Declarant may assign its right to appoint all members of the Architectural Committee to the Association by Recorded written instrument, and thereafter, the Board will have the right to appoint and remove (with or without cause) all members of the Architectural Committee. Any assignment by Declarant of the right to appoint and remove all members of the Architectural Committee may be withdrawn until expiration of the Development Period. If Declarant withdraws its assignment of the right to appoint and remove all members of the Architectural Committee, then on the date of such withdrawal, Declarant will have the right to appoint and remove (with or without cause) all members of the Architectural Committee. Declarant's right to appoint all members of the Architectural Committee will automatically expire upon the expiration of the Development Period. The Architectural Committee will have the right to employ consultants and advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate.

6.04 Submission of Plans. Prior to the initiation of construction of any work required to be approved by the ACA as provided in Section 6.01 above, the Owner (excluding Declarant and any Builder designated in writing by Declarant during the Development Period to be exempt from the ACA approval requirements as provided herein) will first submit to the ACA a complete set of plans and specifications for the proposed improvements, including site plans, landscape plans, exterior elevations, specifications of materials and exterior colors, and any other information deemed necessary by the ACA for the performance of its function. In addition, the Owner will submit the identity of the individual(s) or company(ies) intended to perform the work and projected commencement and completion dates.

## 6.05 Plan Review.

(a) Timing of Review and Response. Upon receipt by the ACA of all of the information required by this Article VI, the ACA will have thirty (30) days in which to review said plans and other documents and materials submitted pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof. No correspondence or request for approval will be deemed to have been received until all requested documents have actually been received by the ACA in form satisfactory to the ACA. If the ACA requests additional information and the applicant fails to provide such information prior to the date stated in the ACA's notice, then the application shall be deemed denied. If the applicable submittal is denied or deemed denied, then the applicant shall be required to re-apply if the applicant still desires to have the ACA consider the request. If the ACA fails to issue its written approval within thirty (30) days after the ACA's receipt of all materials requested by the ACA to complete the submission, then such failure by the ACA to issue its written approval shall be deemed its disapproval of such materials. The ACA may charge a reasonable fee for reviewing requests for approval. It is the responsibility of the Owner seeking approval from the ACA to verify that the ACA has received its request for review and whether approval has been given by the ACA.

(b) Approval Considerations - Aesthetics. The proposed improvements will be approved if, in the sole opinion of the ACA: (i) the improvements will be of an architectural style, quality, color and material that are aesthetically compatible with the improvements within the Property; (ii) the improvements will not violate any term herein or in the ACA Standards; and (iii) the improvements will not have an adverse impact on the Property. Decisions of the ACA may be based on purely aesthetic considerations. The ACA shall have the authority to make final, conclusive and binding determinations on matters of aesthetic judgment and such determination shall not be subject to review so long as the determination is made in good faith and in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. Each Owner acknowledges that opinions on aesthetic matters are subjective and opinions may vary as to the desirability and/or attractiveness of particular improvements and as the ACA and its members change over time.

## 6.06 Timing of Completion of Approved Items. All work approved by the ACA shall be completed within one (1) year after the approval by the ACA or such shorter period that the ACA may specify in the notice of approval, unless the completion is delayed due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the Owner, as determined by the ACA. All work and related improvements shall be in compliance with the items approved by the ACA.

## 6.07 Improvements Impact on Drainage. With respect to any improvements performed on a Lot and/or any alterations to the grade of a yard, the Owner shall take proper precautions to insure that such improvements do not cause the surface water drainage on the Lot to (a) drain onto an adjoining Lot in an amount more than the drainage amount prior to the improvement or alteration, or (b) collect near the foundation of the Dwelling. Although the ACA may comment on and/or deny the approval of plans because of the impact of the proposed improvements or alterations on surface water drainage, the ACA's comments or approval shall not constitute or be construed as a representation, warranty or guaranty that adverse surface water drainage problems will not occur and shall not be relied upon as such. The Owner is responsible for taking the necessary actions in order to avoid any surface water drainage problems, including, without limitation, engaging the services of a qualified consultant.

## 6.08 No Waiver. The approval by the ACA of any plans, drawings or specifications for any work done or proposed, or for any other matter requiring the approval of the ACA under this Declaration, shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to withhold approval of any similar plan, drawing specification or matter subsequently submitted for approval.

## 6.09 Variances. The ACA may grant variances, in its sole and absolute discretion, from compliance with any of the provisions set forth herein, in any ACA Standards or any required procedures. All variances must be evidenced in writing and must be signed by the ACA. If a variance is granted, no violation of the covenants, conditions, or restrictions contained in this Declaration or the ACA Standards, will be deemed to have occurred with respect to the matter for which the variance was granted. The granting of such variance will not operate to waive or amend any of the terms and provisions of this Declaration or the ACA Standards, if any, for any purpose except as to the particular property and in the particular instance covered by the variance, and such variance will not be considered to establish a precedent for any future waiver, modification, or amendment of the terms and provisions of this Declaration or the ACA Standards, if any.

## 6.10 Improvements by Declarant. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Declaration to the contrary, to the extent that any improvements constructed or modified by the Declarant on the Property do not comply with a restriction or requirement contained in this Declaration, the Architectural Control Authority shall be deemed to have granted Declarant a variance from such restriction or requirement and such improvements shall not be considered to violate any restriction or requirement in this Declaration or any of the other Governing Documents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

6.11 Architectural Control Authority Standards. The ACA or the Board may, from time to time and in its sole and absolute discretion, adopt, amend and repeal, by unanimous vote or written consent, ACA Standards. During the Development Period, any adoption, amendment or repeal of the ACA Standards must be approved in advance and in writing by the Declarant. The ACA Standards may not conflict with the terms of this Declaration. In this regard, any conflict between any ACA Standards and the terms of this Declaration shall be controlled by the terms of this Declaration.

6.12 Enforcement; Non-Conforming and Unapproved Improvements. If there are any significant or material deviations from the approved plans in the completed improvements, as determined by the ACA, in its sole and absolute discretion, such improvements will be in violation of this *Article VI* to the same extent as if made without prior approval of the ACA. In addition to the Association's rights in *Section 5.09* hereof, the Association or any Owner may maintain an action at law or in equity for the removal or correction of (a) the non-conforming improvement or alteration, and/or (b) any improvement or alternation to any improvement on any Lot that is not approved by the ACA.

6.13 Liability of Declarant and the Architectural Committee; Indemnity.

(a) Decisions of Declarant and Architectural Committee. Declarant and the members of the Architectural Committee shall have no liability for decisions made by them so long as such decisions are not discriminatory, arbitrary or capricious. Any errors in or omissions from the documents submitted to Declarant or the Architectural Committee shall be the responsibility of the entity or person submitting the documents, and neither Declarant nor the Architectural Committee shall have any obligation to check for errors in or omissions from any such documents, or to check for such documents' compliance with the general provisions of this Declaration, City codes and other regulations, state statutes or the common law, whether the same relate to Lot lines, building lines, easements, building standards or any other issue.

(b) NO LIABILITY OF DECLARANT OR ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE. DECLARANT SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR (I) THE CREATION, SELECTION, MANAGEMENT OR OPERATION OF THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE, (II) ANY ACTIONS TAKEN OR OMITTED TO BE TAKEN BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DECLARATION OR THE PROPERTY, OR (III) ANY LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, DEBTS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, CLAIMS, DEBTS, SUITS OR DAMAGES INCURRED BY OR ON BEHALF OF OR ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE, THE PROPERTY OR THE DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE PURSUANT TO THIS DECLARATION. FURTHERMORE, NEITHER DECLARANT, THE ASSOCIATION, MEMBERS OF THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE, THE BOARD NOR THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF ANY OF THEM, SHALL BE LIABLE IN DAMAGES TO ANYONE SUBMITTING PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS TO ANY OF THEM FOR APPROVAL, OR TO ANY OWNER BY REASON OF MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT, NEGLIGENCE OR NONFEASANCE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OR FAILURE TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE ANY SUCH PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS. EVERY PERSON WHO SUBMITS PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS AND EVERY OWNER AGREES THAT SUCH PERSON WILL NOT BRING ANY ACTION OR SUIT AGAINST DECLARANT, THE ASSOCIATION, THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE, THE BOARD OR THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS OF ANY OF THEM, TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND HEREBY RELEASES AND QUITCLAIMS ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY JUDGMENT, NEGLIGENCE OR NONFEASANCE AND HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW WHICH PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND CAUSES OF ACTION NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME THE RELEASE IS GIVEN. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT REVIEWED, APPROVED AND/OR REJECTED FOR ENGINEERING OR STRUCTURAL DESIGN, ADEQUACY OF MATERIALS OR ADEQUACY OF SOILS OR DRAINAGE, AND BY APPROVING SUCH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS, NEITHER DECLARANT, THE ASSOCIATION, THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE, THE BOARD NOR THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF ANY OF THEM ASSUMES LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY THEREFOR, NOR FOR ANY DEFECT IN ANY STRUCTURE CONSTRUCTED FROM SUCH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

(c) INDEMNIFICATION OF DECLARANT AND ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, SUBJECT TO ANY LIMITATIONS IMPOSED UNDER THE TBOC OR IN THE BYLAWS, THE ASSOCIATION SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE AND DECLARANT PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEYS' FEES, REASONABLY INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY THREATENED, INITIATED OR FILED ACTION, SUIT OR OTHER PROCEEDING (INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY SUIT OR PROCEEDING, IF APPROVED BY THE THEN BOARD) TO WHICH ANY MEMBER OF THE ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE OR ANY OF THE DECLARANT PARTIES MAY BECOME A PARTY BY REASON OF ITS ACTIVITIES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DECLARATION.

## ARTICLE VII
USE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS

7.01 Single-Family Residential Use.

(a) The Property will be used solely for single-family residential purposes.

(b) No professional, business, or commercial activity to which the general public is invited will be conducted on any portion of the Property, except an Owner or such Owner's tenant may conduct business activities within a Dwelling so long as: (i) such activity complies with applicable law; (ii) participation in the business activity is limited to the Owner(s) or tenant(s) of a Dwelling; (iii) the existence or operation of the business activity is not apparent or detectable by sight, i.e., no sign may be erected advertising the business within the Property, sound, or smell from outside the Dwelling; (iv) the business activity does not involve door-to-door solicitation of residents within the Property; (v) the business does not, in the Board's judgment, generate a level of vehicular or pedestrian traffic or a number of vehicles parked within the Property which is noticeably greater than that which is typical of residences in which no business activity is being conducted; (vi) the business activity is consistent with the residential character of the Property and does not constitute a nuisance, or a hazardous or offensive use, or threaten the security or safety of other residents of the Property as may be determined in the sole discretion of the Board; and (vii) the business does not require the installation of any machinery other than that customary to normal household operations. In addition, for the purpose of obtaining any business or commercial license, neither the Dwelling nor the Lot will be considered open to the public. The terms "business" and "trade", as used in this provision, will be construed to have their ordinary, generally accepted meanings and will include, without limitation, any occupation, work, or activity undertaken on an ongoing basis which involves the provision of goods or services to persons other than the provider's family and for which the provider receives a fee, compensation, or other form of consideration, regardless of whether: (x) such activity is engaged in full or part-time; (y) such activity is intended to or does generate a profit; or (z) a license is required.

7.05 Fences.

(a) Required Fencing. The backyard of each Lot must be fully enclosed with a perimeter

unless such Owner obtains the ACA's written approval to modify, replace, relocate or remove such fence in
accordance with the provisions of this Declaration.

(b) Fencing Design and Appearance. All fencing shall comply (including size and location)
with applicable City requirements. Except for fencing installed by Declarant or as otherwise approved by the ACA,
all fencing shall be six (6) feet in height. Unless a specific color is approved by the ACA, fences must be stained or
painted with the same color stain or paint as originally applied by Declarant or a Builder, as applicable. The portion
of all fences which face a street adjoining such Owner's Lot (front, side or rear streets, but not alleys) or which face
a Common Area, open space, park or other recreational area adjoining such Owner's Lot (which area may be
separated by an alley) shall have the smooth surface of the fence materials facing the applicable street or Common

ACA, no fence or wall will be placed (i) on any Lot in a location nearer the street than the front building setback line
for such Lot, or (ii) on those certain corner Lots whose rear boundary line adjoins any portion of another Lot's front
yard of a Lot behind the corner Lot, in a location nearer to the front building setback line for the street that is in front
of the adjoining Lot. The foregoing shall not limit or restrict fences erected in conjunction with model homes or
sales offices. In addition to the foregoing, easements may also restrict the placement of fences.

(d) Maintenance of Fencing. Except with respect to Association Maintenance Fencing, each
Owner shall maintain the portion of fencing on such Owner's Lot in a presentable condition and shall make all repairs
and replacements thereto (as deemed necessary by the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion), except that
Owners adjoining a Common Fence (as provided in Section 7.05(f) hereof) shall share in the cost of such maintenance
as provided in Section 7.05(f) hereof. The Association shall repair and maintain Association Maintenance Fencing as
a Common Expense.

(e) No Changes / Repairs. No fencing may be changed or modified without the prior written
consent of the ACA. This includes changes to design, color, height and materials. Unless approved otherwise by the
ACA, all repairs and replacements to fencing must be done using the same design and type and color of materials so
that such fencing does not appear to have been repaired or replaced, except to the extent of the new appearance
of the repaired or replaced materials.

(f) Common Fencing. Except for Association Maintenance Fencing, side and rear yard fences
that are installed by Declarant or the Builder of the Dwelling to separate adjacent Lots as a common boundary fence
(the "Common Fence") shall be maintained jointly by the Owners whose Lot adjoins such Common Fence and the
costs associated therewith shall be shared equally by said Owners. An Owner is not released from the joint
maintenance obligation even if an Owner constructs a second fence along or near the Common Fence, unless the
other Owner agrees in writing otherwise and the ACA's approval is obtained. If the Owners disagree regarding the
timing, cost or other applicable issue related to the repair or replacement of a Common Fence or any portion thereof,
then either Owner may (i) make the repair or replacement (provided any applicable ACA approval is obtained) and
seek reimbursement from the other Owner of one-half (1/2) of the cost of repair or replacement; and/or (ii) seek
payment from the other Owner of one-half (1/2) of the cost of repair or replacement, subject to the repair or
replacement being made.

7.06 Retaining Walls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

adjacent to (within 3 feet) and generally parallel with another Lot (a "Common Retaining Wall") shall be maintained jointly by the Owner(s) whose Lot the Common Retaining Wall is located on and the Owner whose Lot is adjacent to the Common Retaining Wall (depending upon which is applicable) and the costs associated therewith shall be shared equally by said Owners. An Owner is not released from the joint maintenance obligation unless the other Owner agrees in writing to such release. The Common Retaining Wall shall be maintained in the same location, size, style and design and with the same materials, unless both Owners agree in writing otherwise and the ACA's approval is obtained. If the Owners disagree regarding the timing, cost or other applicable issue related to the repair or replacement of a Common Retaining Wall and/or portion thereof, then either Owner may (i) make the repair or replacement (provided any applicable ACA approval is obtained) and seek reimbursement from the other Owner of one-half (1/2) of the cost of repair or replacement; and/or (ii) seek payment from the other Owner of one-half (1/2) of the cost of repair or replacement, subject to the repair or replacement being made.

(c) Easement for Common Retaining Walls. Common Retaining Walls may or may not be located exactly on the common boundary line between two Lots. Therefore, there is hereby created an easement in and on the Lot where the Common Retaining Wall is actually located. The easement area shall be limited to the area that is within 3 feet of the common boundary line. The easement shall be for the benefit of the Owner of the Lot that adjoins the Common Retaining Wall so that such Owner can maintain the Common Retaining Wall as provided in Section 7.06(a).

The Association will have the right to remove any sign, billboard or other advertising structure that does not comply with the foregoing. Removal shall not subject Declarant, the Board, the Association or the Association's officers to any liability in connection with such removal.

Owners may place ground mounted signs on their Lot which advertise a political candidate or ballot item for an election ("Political Signs"), provided the following criteria are met: (i) no Political Sign may be placed on an Owner's Lot prior to the ninetieth (90th) day before the date of the election to which the sign relates, or remain on an Owner's Lot subsequent to the tenth (10th) day after the election date; (ii) no more than one (1) Political Sign is allowed per political candidate or ballot item; (iii) Political Signs must be ground mounted, displayed only on an Owner's Lot and may not be located on, nor encroach on, another Lot, Common Area, or any property owned or maintained by the Association; and (iv) no Political Sign may (a) contain roofing material, siding, paving materials, flora, one or more balloons or lights, or any other similar building, landscaping, or nonstandard decorative component; (b) be attached in any way to plant material, a traffic control device, a light, a trailer, a vehicle, or any other existing structure or object; (c) include the painting of architectural surfaces; (d) threaten the public health or safety; (e) be larger than four (4) feet by six (6) feet; (f) violate a law; (g) contain language, graphics, or any display that would be offensive to the ordinary person; or (h) be accompanied by music or other sounds or by streamers or is otherwise distracting to motorists.

However, if the Owner determines that the Permitted Device cannot be located in compliance with the foregoing non-visibility requirement without precluding reception of an acceptable quality signal, then the Owner may install the Permitted Device in the least conspicuous alternative location on the Lot where an acceptable quality signal can be obtained. The ACA in the ACA Standards may include rules or provisions regarding the type of additional Permitted Devices and/or the placement of Permitted Devices,

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW

16


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

provided that such ACA Standards do not conflict with the terms of this Section and do not unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use of the Permitted Device. A Permitted Device that complies with the provisions of this Section and the ACA Standards shall not require the ACA's approval prior to installation. However, the ACA shall be the sole and exclusive authority for purposes of determining if the item or device complies with the provisions of this Section and the ACA Standards.

Furthermore, no landscaping (including, without limitation, trees) or improvements may be removed from, or modified or installed within, the Adjacent Areas without the advance written consent of the Board.

(b) In the event an Owner fails or refuses to properly and on a timely basis (both standards to be determined by the Board in the Board's sole and absolute discretion) perform any Adjacent Area Maintenance Work for which it is responsible, such failure will constitute a violation of this Declaration. In such event, without limitation on any other rights or remedies arising out of such violation, the Board may additionally cause such Adjacent Area Maintenance Work to be performed in a manner determined by the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion. If the Board causes any Adjacent Area Maintenance Work to be performed due to an Owner's failure to do so, the Owner otherwise responsible therefor will be liable to the Association for all costs and expenses incurred by the Association for effecting such Adjacent Area Maintenance Work. If such Owner fails to pay such costs and expenses timely upon demand by the Association, such costs and expenses (plus interest from the date of demand until paid at the Designated Interest Rate) will be assessed against and chargeable to the Owner's Lot(s). Any such amounts assessed and chargeable against a Lot hereunder will be secured by the liens reserved in this Declaration for assessments and may be collected by any means provided in this Declaration for the collection of assessments, including, but not limited to, foreclosure of such liens against the Owner's Lot(s).

Declarant and its assignees may also at any time assign, transfer or convey to the Association interests in real or personal property within or for the benefit of the Property, the general public, local governmental entities


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

or districts or otherwise, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Declarant. All or any real or personal property assigned, transferred and/or conveyed by the Declarant to the Association shall be deemed accepted by the Association upon Declarant's or its assignee's assignment, transfer or conveyance to the Association without consent or action by the Association, and shall be considered Common Area without regard to whether such real or personal property is designated by the Declarant as Common Area. If requested by the Declarant, the Association will execute a written instrument, in a form requested by the Declarant, evidencing acceptance of such real or personal property; provided, however, execution of a written consent by the Association shall in no event be a precondition to acceptance by the Association. The assignment, transfer, and/or conveyance of real or personal property to the Association may be by deed without warranty, may reserve easements in favor of the Declarant or a third party designated by Declarant over and across such property, and may include such other provisions, including restrictions on use, determined by the Declarant, in the Declarant's sole and absolute discretion. Property assigned, transferred, and/or conveyed to the Association may be improved or unimproved and may consist of fee simple title, easements, leases, licenses, or other real or personal property interests. ALL PROPERTY CONVEYED TO THE ASSOCIATION WILL BE DEEMED CONVEYED IN ITS THEN "AS-IS" CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT DECLARANT OR ASSIGNEE PROVIDES AN EXPRESS, WRITTEN WARRANTY IN THE DEED OR OTHER DOCUMENT MAKING SUCH CONVEYANCE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL WARRANTIES PERTAINING TO COMMON AREAS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STATUTORY AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, WORKMANLIKE CONSTRUCTION OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED BY DECLARANT AND WAIVED BY THE ASSOCIATION AND EACH OWNER. Upon Declarant's written request, the Association will re-convey to Declarant any unimproved real property that Declarant originally conveyed to the Association for no payment.

8.05 Annual Inspection of Common Area - Budget. From the period commencing on the expiration of the Development Period until ten (10) years thereafter, the Association shall at least annually examine the condition of the Common Area and Common Maintenance Areas to evaluate the quality, frequency and adequacy of maintenance performed during the preceding year, and to recommend maintenance for the upcoming year. The examination and report may be performed by one or more experts hired by the Association for this purpose, such as a professional property manager, an engineer or professional contractors such as landscapers and brick masons. Within fifteen (15) days after performing the inspection, the expert should submit to the Board a written report with findings and recommendations. The Board should evaluate the Association's operating budget and reserve accounts for maintenance, repair and replacement in light of the expert's findings and recommendations. Any decision by the Board to reduce or defer recommended maintenance should be made with an evaluation of the potential consequences for future costs and deterioration. Any expert's report shall be a record of the Association that is available to Owners for inspection and copying.

8.06 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Lakes, Creeks or Drainage Areas. Declarant has informed and hereby informs the Association that any lakes, creeks or drainage areas located within or adjacent to the Property (the "Drainage Areas") are intended primarily for drainage purposes and are not intended as a recreational feature or an amenity with specific aesthetic qualities. DECLARANT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE DRAINAGE AREAS AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE DRAINAGE AREAS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ASSOCIATION AND EACH OWNER ACCEPTS THE DRAINAGE AREAS IN THEIR "AS-IS" CONDITION.

8.07 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Natural Areas. Declarant has informed and hereby informs the Association that certain Common Area or portions thereof, such as existing wetlands, creeks and waterways, drainage areas, water detention facilities and open spaces, may be intended to be unimproved open space to be left or maintained in a natural or semi-natural condition ("Natural Areas") and are not necessarily intended to be a recreational feature or an amenity with specific aesthetic qualities. Neither Declarant nor the Association shall have any obligation to landscape, repair or otherwise improve any Natural Area. DECLARANT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE NATURAL AREAS AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE NATURAL AREAS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ASSOCIATION AND EACH OWNER ACCEPTS THE NATURAL AREAS IN THEIR "AS-IS" CONDITION.

gas and storm water and drainage related structures and improvements. The Association will also have at all times
the right to grant the easements described in this Section.

9.02 Easement to Correct Drainage on Property. During the Development Period and for a period of
five years thereafter, Declarant hereby reserves for the benefit of Declarant and any Builder, a blanket easement on,
over and under the ground within the Property (excluding the area where a Dwelling is located) to maintain and
correct drainage of surface waters and other erosion controls in order to maintain reasonable standards of health,
safety and appearance, and will be entitled to remove trees or vegetation, without liability for replacement or
damages, as may be necessary to provide adequate drainage facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein will be interpreted to impose any duty upon Declarant or any Builder to correct or maintain any drainage
facilities within the Property. Any damage to a Lot caused by or due to the exercise of the foregoing drainage
easement rights, shall be promptly repaired by the party exercising such easement rights after completing its
construction activities in the damaged area.

9.03 Easement for Right to Enter Lot. If an Owner fails to maintain its Lot as required herein, or in the
event of emergency, the Association will have the right to enter upon the Lot to make repairs and to do other work
reasonably necessary for the proper maintenance and operation of the Property. Entry upon the Lot as provided
herein will not be deemed a trespass, and the Association will not be liable for any damage so created unless such
damage is caused by the Association's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

9.04 Easement Over Common Area. During the Development Period and for a period of ten years
thereafter, Declarant and it licensees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter upon the Common Area
for purposes of inspecting, improving, modifying and repairing the Common Area and/or any improvements thereon
at Declarant's expense; provided; however, nothing contained herein shall obligate Declarant to make any such
inspections, improvements or repairs.

9.05 Temporary Easement to Complete Construction. All Lots will be subject to an easement of ingress
and egress for the benefit of Declarant, its employees, subcontractors, successors and assigns, over and upon the
front, side and rear yards of the Lots as may be expedient or necessary for the construction, servicing and completion
of Dwellings and landscaping upon adjacent Lots, provided that such easement will terminate as to any Lot two years
after the date such Lot is conveyed to an Owner other than a Builder. Any damage to a Lot caused by Declarant due
to exercise of the foregoing completion easement rights, shall be promptly repaired by the party exercising such
easement rights after completing its construction activities in the damaged area.

9.06 Association Easement. Declarant hereby reserves for the benefit of Declarant and the Association
an Association Easement over those portions of each Lot for which access is reasonably necessary for repairing and
maintaining Entry Signs (and associated equipment and landscaping), Association Maintenance Fencing, Association

Easement shall be conveyed subject to the Association Easement.

9.07 Easement for Mailboxes. Mailboxes will be located and constructed within the Community as
determined by the U.S. Postal Service (the "USPS"). Declarant hereby reserves for the benefit of the USPS, Declarant
and the Association an easement over those portions of each Lot and Common Area as may be designated for the
installation of a mailbox, together with space reasonably necessary for the installation and maintenance of same

that Lot, group or clustered mailboxes on Lots or Common Areas serving more than one Dwelling, or as otherwise
determined by the USPS. No Owner may disturb the mailbox improvements within the Mailbox Easement Area,
obstruct access to the Mailbox Easement Area or construct improvements within the Mailbox Easement Area
without the prior written consent of the Association. The Association shall have the right to adopt reasonable rules
and regulations governing the use of each Mailbox Easement Area.

9.08 Easement to Inspect and Right to Correct. During the Development Period and for a period of
ten years thereafter, Declarant reserves for itself, its assigns and for the Declarant's architect, engineer, other design
professionals, builder and contractors the right, but not the duty, to inspect, monitor, test, redesign, repair, correct,
and relocate any structure, improvement, or condition that may exist on any portion of the Property, including the
Lots, and a perpetual nonexclusive easement of access throughout the Property to the extent reasonably necessary
to exercise this right. The party exercising such rights will promptly repair, at its sole expense, any damage resulting
from the exercise of this right. This Section may not be construed to create a duty for Declarant, the Association, or
any architect, engineer, design professional, builder or contractor, and may not be amended without Declarant's
advanced written consent. In support of this reservation, each Owner, by accepting an interest in or title to a Lot,
hereby grants to Declarant an easement of access and entry over, across, under, and through the Property, including

ARTICLE XI
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

11.01 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Introduction. This Article is intended to encourage the resolution of certain disputes that
may involve or affect the Association, its Members and/or the Property. Such disputes may create significant
financial exposure for the Association and its Members, affect each Member's use and enjoyment of their Lot and
the Common Areas, interfere with the resale and refinancing of Lots, and cause strife and tension among Members,
the Board and the Association's management. Accordingly, this Article requires transparency and, in certain
circumstances, Owner participation. Transparency means that inspection reports concerning Common Areas related
to a dispute are prepared by an independent, professional engineer free from improper influence, and Owners are
informed in advance about certain disputes and proposed arrangements between the Association and a law firm or
attorney who may represent the Association in the dispute. Owner participation means that in certain situations
Owners will have an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding whether the Association
should pursue a claim and engage an attorney or law firm for that purpose.

(b) Agreement to Resolve Disputes; Application; Definitions. The Association, Owners, the
Declarant, all persons subject to this Declaration, and each person not otherwise subject to this Declaration who
agrees to submit to this Article by written instrument delivered to a Claimant (defined below), which may include,
but is not limited to, a Builder, a general contractor, sub-contractor, or design professional (individually, a "Party"
and collectively, the "Parties"), agree to encourage the amicable resolution of disputes covered by this Article to
avoid the costs of litigation and arbitration if at all possible. Accordingly, each Party agrees to be subject to the
requirements of this Article and agrees this Article applies to all Claims (as defined below). The following words,
when capitalized, have the following meanings:

"Claim" means any claim, cause of action, grievance or dispute:

(i) relating to the rights and/or duties of the Association, the Board, the ACA or the Declarant
under the Governing Documents;

(ii) relating to the acts or omissions of the Association, the Board, any Board member, any
officer of the Association, or the ACA; any acts or omissions of the Declarant during the
Declarant's control and administration of the Board or the ACA; or any exercise by
Declarant of any rights of Declarant under the Governing Documents, including but not
limited to relating to budgets, reserves, assessments, contributions, deficit funding,
expenditures, claims of financial guarantees and other financial and accounting matters;
or

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW
23


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

(iii) relating to the design, construction, repair, alteration or maintenance, or warranty with respect thereto, of the Common Area or Common Maintenance Area or any improvements located thereon (a "Common Area Claim"; for purposes of this Article, the term "Common Areas" shall refer to both Common Areas and Common Maintenance Areas).

"Claimant" means any Party having a Claim against any other Party.

"Respondent" means any Party against which a Claim has been or may be asserted by a Claimant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Claim does not include and this Article does not apply to (i) a claim by the Association for assessments or any action by the Association to collect assessments, (ii) any action to enforce the easements, architectural control, maintenance and use restrictions or rules contained in this Declaration or the other Governing Documents, or (iii) a claim for or related to injuries to or the death of a person. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article, any claim brought by an Owner related to the design or construction of a Dwelling, a Lot or an improvement on a Lot will not be subject to this Article, but will be governed exclusively by the express or implied warranty provided by the Builder or contractor which constructed such dwelling or improvement and any other agreements between the Owner of such Lot (or its predecessor in title) and such Builder or contractor.

11.02 Mandatory Procedures. A Claimant may not initiate, participate in or maintain any proceeding before any judge, jury, arbitrator or any judicial or administrative tribunal seeking redress or resolution of a Claim until the Claimant has complied with the applicable procedures of this Article. As provided in Section 11.05 below, all Claims not resolved through negotiation must be submitted to mediation. As provided in Section 11.06 below, all Claims not resolved through negotiation or mediation must be resolved by binding arbitration.

Informal Resolution of Claims

The Parties are encouraged to informally communicate to amicably and efficiently resolve disputes. A Claimant is not required to follow the mandatory procedures in this Article unless a Claim is not resolved and the Claimant desires to pursue a Claim and initiate a proceeding described in Section 11.02 above.

Common Areas

Prior to pursuing a Common Area Claim, the Association (or an Owner if determined allowed by the jurisdiction) must comply with the requirements of Section 11.09 below.

11.03 Notice of Claim. To pursue a Claim, a Claimant must send each Respondent written notice of the Claim (the "Notice") stating plainly: (i) the nature of the Claim, including date, time, location, persons involved and Respondent's role in the Claim; (ii) the basis of the Claim (i.e., the provision of the Governing Documents or other authority from which the Claim arises or which supports the Claim); (iii) what Claimant wants Respondent to do or not do to resolve the Claim; and (iv) that the Notice is given pursuant to this Section 11.03 of this Declaration. If the Claim is a Common Area Claim, the Notice must also include a signed resolution of the Board confirming that Members holding a Majority of the total votes in the Association approved pursuing the Claim in accordance with Section 11.09(c) below. The Notice must be sent to each Respondent via certified mail, return receipt requested.

11.04 Negotiation. Within sixty (60) days after Respondent's receipt of the Notice, Respondent and Claimant will meet at a mutually acceptable place and time in an effort to resolve the Claim by good faith negotiation. If the Claim involves or may affect any portion of the Property, then at such meeting or another mutually-agreeable time, Respondent and its representatives will be given access to, and the opportunity to inspect, such portions of the Property.

11.05 Mediation. If the Parties do not resolve the Claim through negotiation within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the Notice (or within such other period as may be agreed on by the Parties), either Claimant or a Respondent may submit the Claim to mediation with the assistance of a mediator on which the parties mutually agree. The mediator must have at least five (5) years of experience serving as a mediator and with expertise appropriate to the subject matter of the Claim. If the Parties do not settle the Claim within thirty (30) days after submission to mediation, either Respondent or Claimant may initiate arbitration proceedings in accordance with Section 11.06.

11.06 Arbitration. All Claims not resolved through negotiation and mediation must be resolved by binding arbitration as provided below. However, Claimant or Respondent may bring an action in court seeking injunctive relief to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable harm, seeking relief that would otherwise be

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW
24


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

unavailable in arbitration, or to compel arbitration of any Claim not referred to arbitration as required by this Section 11.06.

## (a) Governing Rules.
If a Claim has not been resolved after mediation in accordance with Section 11.05, the Claim will be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") conducted in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the Claim is a Common Area Claim, then those rules shall be the AAA's Construction Industry Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures. The periods of limitation under applicable law shall apply to any Claim and arbitration proceeding under this Article. In the event of any inconsistency between the applicable AAA rules and this Section 11.06, this Section 11.06 will control. The decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and, except as provided below, not subject to appeal, but may be reduced to judgment or enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

## (b) Award.
To resolve Claims, the arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief the arbitrator deems just and equitable; provided, however, the arbitrator's decision and award must be in accordance with applicable law and may not violate this Section 11.06 or Section 11.07 below. In each proceeding, the arbitrator shall make specific, written findings of fact and conclusions of law. In no event may an arbitrator award speculative, consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, treble or punitive damages for any Claim. In addition, if a Claim or any portion of a Claim is governed by Chapter 27 of the Texas Property Code or any successor statute, in no event shall the arbitrator award damages which exceed the damages a Claimant would be entitled to under Chapter 27 of the Texas Property Code. In addition to any right of appeal or review under the FAA or applicable AAA rules, any Party may appeal or seek vacation or modification of an award that is based in whole or in part on: (i) factual findings that have no legally or factually sufficient evidence, as those terms are defined under applicable law; (ii) conclusions of law that are erroneous; (iii) an error of applicable law; or (iv) a cause of action or remedy not expressly provided under applicable law.

## (c) Other Matters.
To the maximum extent practicable, an arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be concluded within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the filing of the Claim for arbitration. Arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be conducted in the County. Any Party to a Claim shall have the right to join in the proceedings any contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional involved in the design or construction of improvements that are the subject of the Claim. Except as otherwise provided by this Section 11.06 or 11.07, the arbitrator may impose sanctions and take other actions as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could do so pursuant to applicable law. Claimant and each Respondent agree to keep all Claims and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential, except for disclosures of information required in the ordinary course of business of the parties or by applicable law. In no event shall a Party discuss a Claim with the news media or issue a press release regarding a Claim without the written consent of all other parties to the Claim.

## 11.07 Costs.
Except as provided in the following sentence, each Party shall bear all of its own costs incurred in bringing or responding to a Claim or otherwise complying with the dispute resolution process contained in this Article, including without limitation its attorney's fees and costs, and none of such costs may be allocated or awarded to either Party by an arbitrator. If Claimant files an action in a court of law prior to complying with the applicable dispute resolution procedures in this Article, then Claimant shall reimburse the other Parties for the costs, including attorneys' fees, of dismissing or staying such action. Claimant and each Respondent will equally divide all expenses and fees charged by the mediator and arbitrator.

## 11.08 Funding Association Claims.
If the Association intends to pursue a Claim and a reasonable estimate of the attorneys' fees, inspection costs, consultant and expert fees, arbitration fees and other costs that may be incurred as a result of prosecuting the Claim (whether incurred by the Association directly or for which the Association may be liable) exceeds $10,000, then the Association must levy a special assessment to fund the estimated costs to pursue and resolve such Claim in accordance with this Article. The Association may not use its annual operating income or reserve funds to fund the costs to pursue and resolve a Claim, but the Association may use a previously established and funded dispute resolution fund.

## 11.09 Claims Relating to Common Areas.
As stated in Section 5.10 above, the Association does not have the power or right to institute, pursue, join, defend, intervene in or settle litigation, arbitration or other proceedings (i) in the name of or on behalf of an Owner (whether one or more) or (ii) pertaining to a claim relating to the design or construction of a Dwelling, a Lot, or any improvements on a Lot (other than a Claim relating to Common Maintenance Areas on one or more Lots). Each Owner, by accepting an interest in or title to a Lot, grants and assigns to the Association the exclusive right to institute, pursue, join, defend, intervene in and settle litigation, arbitration or other proceedings relating Common Area Claims. If the Association desires to assert a Common Area Claim, as a precondition to providing the Notice required by Section 11.03 and initiating the mandatory dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Article, the Association must comply with subsections (a), (b) and (c) below:

## (a) Obtain a Common Area Report.
The Association must obtain a written report (the "Common Area Report") prepared by an independent professional engineer licensed by the state in which the

DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR BLUFFVIEW 25


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

Property is located with an office located in the County (the "Inspection Company") assessing the condition of the Common Areas the subject of the Claim. The requirements for the Common Area Report are intended to provide assurance to the Association, Owners and Respondents that the report was prepared by an independent professional and the substance, conclusions and recommendations contained in the report have not been affected by improper influences or influences that could have compromised the professional judgment of the party preparing the report. The Common Area Report must include: (i) a description and photographs of the Common Area the subject of the Claim and its present condition; (ii) a description of any modifications, maintenance, or repairs to same performed by any party; and (iii) if the report identifies deficient or defective conditions, a detailed description of any recommended repairs, including the specific process, procedures and materials required to repair such deficient or defective conditions, and the estimated costs to effect such repairs. Such estimated repair costs shall be obtained from independent, third-party contractors, each with an office located in the County and holding all licenses required by applicable law to perform the recommended repair work. The Common Area Report must be an "independent" report obtained directly by the Association, which means: (i) the Inspection Company may not have an arrangement or agreement to provide consulting and/or engineering services with a law firm or attorney that presently represents or proposes to represent the Association; (ii) the costs to prepare the Common Area Report must be paid directly by the Association to the Inspection Company at the time the Common Area Report is completed and delivered to the Association; and (iii) a law firm or attorney that presently represents or proposes to represent the Association may not have agreed, conditionally or unconditionally, to reimburse the Association for the cost of the Common Area Report.

(b) Provide Notice of the Defective Condition and Opportunity to Inspect and Repair.
Within thirty (30) days after the Association receives the Common Area Report, the Association must send each Respondent a written notice of the Common Area Claim identifying in reasonable detail each deficient or defective condition in the Common Area that is the subject of the Claim, together with a complete copy of the Common Area Report and any other report, study, analysis and recommendation obtained by the Association relating to the Common Areas the subject of the Claim. Such notice must be sent to each Respondent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or via overnight delivery service with proof of delivery. From the date of receipt of such notice and for ninety (90) days thereafter, each Respondent shall have the right to: (a) inspect any condition identified in the Common Area Report as defective or deficient; (b) contact the Inspection Company for additional information needed to clarify any finding or statement in the Common Area Report; and (c) repair or correct any one or more of the conditions identified as being defective or deficient (if a Respondent commences the repair or correction of one or more conditions identified as being defective or deficient, the Respondent shall have the time reasonably necessary to complete such repair or correction). As provided in Section 9.08 above, the Declarant has an easement throughout the Property for itself, its successors, assigns, architects, engineers, design professionals, each Builder and their contractors that may be utilized to correct any such conditions identified in the Common Area Report. For Claims governed by Chapter 27 of the Texas Property Code, the Claimant and each Respondent shall comply with the inspection, offer of settlement or repair, and other requirements of Section 27.004 of the Texas Property Code during the time from and after each Respondent's receipt of the notice described in this subparagraph above. The Parties agree that an "appurtenance" under Chapter 27 of the Texas Property Code means only a structure or recreational facility that is located on a Lot and was constructed for the exclusive use and benefit of the Dwelling on such Lot. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to modify or extend the time periods set forth in Section 27.004 of the Texas Property Code.

(c) Obtain Approval of Owners to Pursue Claim. The requirements related to Owner approval are intended to ensure the Owners are fully informed of and approve the potential costs the Association and Owners may incur in prosecuting a Common Area Claim, the time that prosecuting such a claim may take, and the financial and other effects that prosecuting such a claim may have on the Association and its Owners. Accordingly, the Association must obtain the approval of Members holding a Majority of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by all Members of the Association at a meeting of the Members called in accordance with the Bylaws to provide the Notice described in Section 11.03, initiate the mandatory dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Article, or take any other action to prosecute a Common Area Claim. The notice of such meeting must include (in addition to any requirements set forth in the Bylaws): (i) a description of the Common Area Claim, the relief sought, an estimate of the time it will take to prosecute the Claim and the likelihood of success; (ii) a copy of the Common Area Report; (iii) an estimate of the attorney fees, consultant fees, expert fees, arbitration fees and other costs that may be incurred as a result of prosecuting the Claim, whether incurred by the Association directly or for which the Association may be liable; (iv) a summary of the steps previously taken by the Association to resolve the Claim; (v) a statement that initiating arbitration or any legal action to resolve the Claim may affect the market value, marketability, or refinancing of a Lot while the Claim is being prosecuted; and (vi) a description of the manner in which the Association proposes to fund the cost of prosecuting the Claim. The notice required by this paragraph must be prepared and signed by a person who is not the attorney or member of the law firm who represents or is proposed to represent the Association with respect to the Claim, or retained or employed by or otherwise affiliated

with the law firm of the attorney who represents or is proposed to represent the Association with respect to the Claim. If the Members so approve pursuing the Common Area Claim, Members holding a Majority of the votes in the Association, at a special meeting called in accordance with the Bylaws, may elect to discontinue pursuit of the Claim.

If the Association desires to engage or execute an agreement with a law firm or attorney to investigate or prosecute a Common Area Claim, then the Members should be informed of, and have the opportunity to approve, the financial arrangements between the Association and the law firm or attorney proposed to be engaged. Among other financial arrangements, the engagement agreement between the Association and the law firm or attorney could require the Association to pay fees and expenses to the law firm or attorney which will be paid through assessments levied against Owners, or may require the Association to pay fees and expenses if the relationship between the Association and the law firm or attorney is terminated, if the Association elects not to engage the law firm or attorney to prosecute the Claim, or if the Association agrees to settle the Claim. Such financial obligations could have a significant effect on the Association and its Members. Accordingly, before the Association engages or executes an agreement with a law firm or attorney to investigate or prosecute a Common Area Claim, the law firm or attorney and the financial arrangements and agreements between the Association and the law firm or attorney (collectively, an "Engagement Agreement") must be approved by Members holding a Majority of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by all members of the Association at the meeting of the Members described in the preceding paragraph. In that case, the meeting notice to the Members must also include: (a) the name of the law firm and attorney; (b) a copy of the Engagement Agreement; (c) an estimate of the fees and expenses that may be required to be paid by the Association under the Engagement Agreement; (d) the conditions upon which such fees and expenses may be required to be paid by the Association; and (e) a description of the process the law firm or attorney will use to evaluate the Claim and whether destructive testing will be required (i.e., the removal of portions of the Common Area or improvements on the Property). If destructive testing will be required or is likely to occur, the notice shall contain (i) a description of the destructive testing, (ii) the likely locations of the destructive testing, (iii) whether the Owners' use of their Lots or any Common Area will be interrupted or affected by such testing, (iv) the means or methods the Association will use to repair the Common Area or improvements affected by such testing, and (v) the estimated costs for such testing and repairs, along with an estimate of the assessments that may be levied against the Owners to pay for the costs of such testing and repairs. Unless approved by the Members as provided above, the Association shall not have the authority to enter into, and shall not enter into, an Engagement Agreement with a law firm or attorney to investigate or prosecute a Common Area Claim. All Engagement Agreements must be in writing. Neither the Board nor any officer of the Association shall have the authority to pay any fees, expenses or other charges to a law firm or attorney relating to evaluating, investigating or asserting a Common Area Claim unless same is pursuant to a written Engagement Agreement approved by the Owners in accordance with this Section.

11.10 Claims by Owner(s) Relating to Common Areas. Pursuant to Section 11.09 above, an Owner does not have the power or right to institute, defend, intervene in, settle or compromise litigation, arbitration or other proceedings relating to the design or construction of the Common Areas or Common Maintenance Areas. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator determines that an Owner does have the power or right to institute, defend, intervene in, settle or compromise litigation, arbitration or other proceedings relating to the design or construction of the Common Areas or Common Maintenance Areas, since a Claim affecting the Common Areas or Common Maintenance Areas could affect all Owners, such Owner shall be required, as a precondition to providing the Notice defined in Section 11.03, initiating the mandatory dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Article, or taking any other action to prosecute such a Claim, to comply with the requirements of Section 11.09(a) – (c). Additionally, class action proceedings are prohibited, and no Owner shall be entitled to prosecute, participate, initiate, or join any litigation, arbitration or other proceedings as a class member or class representative in any such proceedings under this Declaration.

ARTICLE XII
TERM, AMENDMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT

12.01 Declaration Term - Perpetual. The terms, covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, charges, and liens set out in this Declaration will run with and bind the Property, and will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Association, and every Owner, including Declarant, and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns, for a term beginning on the date this Declaration is Recorded, and continuing through and including January 1, 2066, after which time this Declaration will be automatically extended for successive periods of ten (10) years unless a change (the word "change" meaning a termination, or change of term or renewal term) is approved in a resolution adopted by Members entitled to cast at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the total number of votes of the Association, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for such purpose, written notice of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

which will be given to all Members at least thirty (30) days in advance and will set forth the purpose of such meeting; provided, however, that such change will be effective only upon the Recording of a certified copy of such resolution. The foregoing sentence shall in no way be interpreted to mean sixty-seven percent (67%) of a quorum as established pursuant to the Bylaws. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section to the contrary, if any provision of this Declaration would be unlawful, void, or voidable by reason of any applicable law restricting the period of time that covenants on land may be enforced, such provision will expire twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last survivor of the now living, as of the date that this document is first Recorded, descendants of Elizabeth II, Queen of England.

## 12.02 Amendments to Declaration.

(a) Amendment by Declarant. While Declarant owns any real property subject to this Declaration, Declarant, in its sole discretion and without a vote or the consent of any other party, shall have the right to amend this Declaration for any purpose by the Recording of an instrument executed by Declarant. Specifically, and without limiting the preceding sentence, Declarant may unilaterally amend this Declaration: (i) to bring any provision into compliance with applicable law; (ii) to resolve conflicts, clarify ambiguities and to correct misstatements, errors or omissions in this Declaration; (iii) to enable any reputable title insurance company to issue title insurance coverage on any Lot; (iv) to enable any institutional or governmental lender, purchaser, insurer or guarantor of mortgage loans, including, for example, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, to make, purchase, insure or guarantee mortgage loans on Lots; or (v) to comply with any requirements promulgated by a local, state or governmental agency, including, for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

(b) Amendment by Association. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Declaration may be amended or terminated by the Recording of an instrument executed and acknowledged by the president and secretary of the Association setting forth the amendment and certifying that such amendment has been approved by Declarant (until expiration or termination of the Development Period) and Members entitled to cast at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by all members of the Association. The foregoing sentence shall not be interpreted to mean sixty-seven percent (67%) of a quorum as established pursuant to the Bylaws. No amendment will be effective without the written consent of Declarant, its successors or assigns during the Development Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whether during or after the Development Period, (i) the Association shall be required to obtain Declarant's written consent to any amendment to Section 3.02(b), Section 4.05, Section 5.10, Section 5.11, Section 6.10, Section 6.11, Section 6.13, Article IX, Article X or Article XI; and (ii) if any amendment to this Declaration will affect a Claim or the process of resolving a Claim against Declarant, such amendment may not apply retroactively to a Claim based on acts or omissions alleged to have occurred prior to the date of the amendment.

## 12.03 Enforcement by Association and/or Owner. Except as otherwise provided herein, any Owner of Lot, at such Owner's own expense, Declarant and the Association will have the right to enforce, by a proceeding at law or in equity, the Governing Documents. The Association and/or the Declarant may initiate, defend or intervene in any action brought to enforce any provision of the Governing Documents. Such right of enforcement will include both damages for and injunctive relief against the breach of any provision hereof. Every act or omission whereby any provision of the Governing Documents is violated, in whole or in part, is hereby declared to be a nuisance and may be enjoined or abated by any Owner of a Lot (at such Owner's own expense), Declarant or the Association. Any violation of any applicable law pertaining to the ownership, occupancy, or use of any portion of the Property, the Common Area, or the Common Maintenance Areas is hereby declared to be a violation of this Declaration and subject to all of the enforcement procedures set forth herein. Failure to enforce any right, provision, covenant, or condition set forth in the Governing Documents will not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce such right, provision, covenants or condition in the future. Failure of the Declarant or the Association to enforce the terms and provisions of the Governing Documents shall in no event give rise to any claim or liability against the Declarant, the Association, or any of their partners, directors, officers, or agents. EACH OWNER, BY ACCEPTING TITLE TO ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE PROPERTY, HEREBY RELEASES AND SHALL HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE DECLARANT, THE ASSOCIATION, AND THEIR PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, OR AGENTS FROM AND AGAINST ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAILURE OF THE DECLARANT OR THE ASSOCIATION TO ENFORCE THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.

## 12.04 Remedies; Cumulative. In the event any Lot does not comply with the terms hereof or any Owner fails to comply with the terms hereof, the Association and/or any Owner will have each and all of the rights and remedies which may be provided for in this Declaration, the Bylaws and any rules and regulations, and those which may be available at law or in equity, including, without limitation, enforcement of any lien, damages, injunction, specific performance, judgment for payment of money and collection thereof, or for any combination of remedies, or for any other relief. No remedies herein provided or available at law or in equity will be deemed mutually exclusive of any other such remedy, but instead shall be cumulative.

12.05 Rights and Obligations Run With Land. The provisions of this Declaration are covenants running
with the land and will inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, each and all of the Owners and their respective
heirs, representatives, successors, assigns, purchasers, grantees and mortgagees. No Lot is exempt from the terms
set forth herein. By the recording or the acceptance of a deed conveying a Lot or any ownership interest in the Lot
whatsoever, the person to whom such Lot or interest is conveyed will be deemed to accept and agree to be bound
by and subject to all of the provisions of this Declaration, whether or not mention thereof is made in said deed.
Notwithstanding any provision herein, the rights of Declarant as provided herein shall not run with the land, but
instead may only be transferred or assigned as provided in Section 13.05 hereof.

ARTICLE XIII
NOTICES, DISCLOSURES AND DISCLAIMERS

13.01 Notices. Except as otherwise provided in the Bylaws or this Declaration, all notices, demands,
bills, statements and other communications under this Declaration shall be in writing and shall be given personally
or by mail. Notices that are mailed shall be deemed to have been duly given three (3) days after deposit, unless such
mail service can prove receipt at an earlier date. Owners shall maintain one mailing address for a Lot, which address
shall be used by the Association for mailing of notices, statements and demands. If an Owner fails to maintain a
current mailing address for a Lot with the Association, then the address of that Owner's Lot is deemed to be such
Owner's mailing address. If a Lot is owned by more than one person or entity, then notice to one co-owner is deemed
notice to all co-owners. Attendance by a Member at any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice by the Member
of the time, place and purpose of the meeting. Written waiver of notice of a meeting, either before or after a
meeting, of the Members shall be deemed the equivalent of proper notice.

13.02 Notice to Association of Sale or Transfer. Any Owner (other than Declarant) desiring to sell or
otherwise transfer title to his or her Lot shall give the Board written notice of the name and address of the purchaser
or transferee, within thirty (30) days after the date of such transfer of title, and such other information as the Board
may reasonably require. With the Board's approval a number of independent fees may be charged in relation to the
transfer of title to a Lot, including, but not limited to, fees for resale certificates, estoppel certificates, copies of this
Declaration, the Bylaws and/or the Certificate, compliance inspections, ownership record changes and priority
processing, provided the fees are customary in amount, kind and number for the local marketplace. Transfer-related
fees are not refundable and may not be regarded as a prepayment of or credit against regular or special assessments.
Transfer-related fees do not apply to the following transfers unless a party to the transfer requests the corresponding
documentation: foreclosure of a deed of trust lien, tax lien or the Association's assessment lien; transfer to, from or
by the Association; or voluntary transfer by an owner to one or more co-owners, or to the owner's spouse, child or
parent. Transfer-related fees may be charged by the Association or by the Association's managing agent, provided
there is no duplication of fees. Transfer-related fees charged by or paid to a managing agent must have the prior
written approval of the Association, are not subject to the Association's assessment lien, and are not payable by the
Association. This Section does not obligate the Board or the manager to levy transfer-related fees.

13.03 Limitation on Interest. All agreements between any Owner and the Association and/or Declarant
are expressly limited so that the amount of interest charged, collected or received on account of such agreement
shall never exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If, under any circumstances, fulfillment of
any provision of this Declaration or of any other document requires exceeding the lawful maximum interest rates,
then, ipso facto, the obligation shall be reduced to comply with such lawful limits. If an amount received by the
Association and/or Declarant should be deemed to be excessive interest, then the amount of such excess shall be
applied to reduce the unpaid principal and not to the payment of interest. If such excessive interest exceeds the
unpaid balance due to the Association and/or Declarant, then such excess shall be refunded to Owner.

13.04 Not a Condominium. This document does not and is not intended to create a condominium within
the meaning of the Texas Uniform Condominium Act, Tex. Prop. Code Ann., Section 82.001, et seq.

13.05 Assignment of Declarant's Rights. Declarant may assign, in whole or in part, its rights as Declarant
by executing a document assigning such rights. There may be more than one Declarant, if Declarant makes a partial
assignment of Declarant status. If at any time there is more than one Declarant, a Declarant may only assign its
rights as a Declarant in whole to a single person or entity unless otherwise approved by the other Declarants.
Without limiting other provisions of this Declaration, upon a Declarant's assignment of any or all of its rights as
Declarant under this Declaration, the assigning Declarant shall automatically, without further acknowledgment or
consent of any other party, be fully released and discharged from any obligations accruing under this Declaration
after the date of such assignment, including, without limitation, the obligation of such assigning Declarant to fund
Budget Deficits arising after such assignment. If at any time there is more than one Declarant and a Declarant no

29


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

longer owns any real property within the Property, then such Declarant's rights that apply or are exercisable only during the Development Period automatically shall be deemed to have been assigned to the remaining Declarant(s).

13.06 Security. Each Owner and resident of a Lot, and their respective guests and invitees, shall be responsible for their own personal safety and the security of their property within the Property, the Common Area, or the Common Maintenance Areas. The Association may, but shall not be obligated to, maintain or support certain activities within the Property, the Common Area, or the Common Maintenance Areas designed to promote or enhance the level of safety or security which each person provides for himself or herself and his or her property. HOWEVER, NEITHER THE ASSOCIATION NOR THE DECLARANT NOR THE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS OF SUCH ENTITIES SHALL IN ANY WAY BE CONSIDERED INSURERS OR GUARANTORS OF SAFETY OR SECURITY WITHIN THE PROPERTY, THE COMMON AREA, OR THE COMMΟΝ ΜΑΙΝΤΕΝNANCE AREAS, NOR SHALL THEY BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO AN OWNER'S OR RESIDENT'S, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE GUEST'S AND INVITEE'S, PRESENCE IN OR USE OF ANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY OF THE COMMON AREA, OR THE COMMON MAINTENANCE AREAS OR IMPROVEMENTS THEREIN. NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IS MADE THAT ANY SYSTEMS OR MEASURES, INCLUDING SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEMS, WALLS AND GATES CANNOT BE COMPROMISED OR CIRCUMVENTED; OR THAT ANY SUCH SYSTEM OR SECURITY MEASURES UNDERTAKEN WILL IN ALL CASES PREVENT LOSS OR PROVIDE THE DETECTION OR PROTECTION FOR WHICH THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED OR INTENDED. EACH OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES, UNDERSTANDS, AND SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMING ANY RESIDENTS OF SUCH OWNER'S LOT THAT NEITHER THE ASSOCIATION, NOR THE DECLARANT, NOR THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND COMMITTEES OF SUCH ENTITIES, ARE INSURERS OR GUARANTORS OF SECURITY OR SAFETY AND THAT EACH PERSON WITHIN THE PROPERTY AND THE COMMON ΜΑΙΝΤΕΝΑNCE AREAS ASSUMES ALL RISKS OF PERSONAL INJURY AND LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY RESULTING FROM ACTS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS TO ANY RESIDENCES OR IMPROVEMENTS CONSTRUCTED UPON ANY LOT AND THE CONTENTS LOCATED THEREIN.

13.07 Privacy. While the Association may adopt policies or procedures designed, directly or indirectly, to support the privacy of persons, property and/or data, the Association shall have no obligation to do so, and each Owner, resident and occupant agrees and accepts the Association does not guarantee the privacy of any person or his or her property or data. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER THE ASSOCIATION NOR THE DECLARANT SHALL HAVE ANY DUTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF ANY OWNER, RESIDENT OR OCCUPANT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PRIVACY OF HIS OR HER PERSON, PROPERTY OR DATA, AND EACH OWNER, RESIDENT AND OCCUPANT RELEASES THE ASSOCIATION AND DECLARANT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BOARD MEMBERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FROM ANY LIABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND DAMAGE OF EVERY KIND RELATING TO PRIVACY OR A BREACH, LOSS OR INVASION OF PRIVACY.

13.08 Adjacent Land Use. Although this Declaration may contain disclosures about the Property or its location on the date of this Declaration, Declarant makes no representation that these are the only noteworthy features of the Property or its location. A prospective owner or resident must make his own inspection of the Property, its location and nearby land uses, and make inquiries of anything that concerns him. Declarant makes no representation of any kind as to current or future uses, actual or permitted, of any land that is adjacent to or near the Property, regardless of what any plat, plan or drawing shows as potential uses of adjoining land. Declarant and the Association cannot and do not guaranty scenic views, volumes of traffic on streets around and through the Property, availability of schools or shopping, or any other aspect of the Property that is affected by the uses or conditions of adjacent or nearby land, water or air. No sales agent, realtor or other party has the authority to make any representation on behalf of Declarant.

ARTICLE XIV
MISCELLANEOUS

14.01 Construction and Interpretation. This Declaration shall be liberally construed and interpreted to give effect to its purposes and intent, except as otherwise required by law.

14.02 Severability. If any provision (or any part of any provision) contained in this Declaration shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision, this Declaration shall be reformed and construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or part thereof) had never been contained herein (but only to the extent it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable), and such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be reformed so that it would be valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent possible.

14.03 Attorneys' Fees and Court Costs. If litigation is instituted to enforce any provision herein, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to all attorneys' fees and court costs related to such legal action.
